GCI-Simulator
===
> The **G**arbage **C**ollector **C**ontrol **I**nterceptor (**[GCI](https://github.com/gcinterceptor/gci-go)**) **Simulator** 
is the simulator used to study GCI on web cloud applications where multiples instances 
of services are used. The main objective here is to simulate web applications using GCI and not using GCI.

### Frameworks & Libraries 
* [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

### Dependencies
* [Python3 interpreter](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/simpy_intro/installation.html)

### Requirements
* Have experimental results CSVâ€™s with the following information: 
  * **Service time**: A CSV with the service time of each request processed in experiment. 
  * **Processed requests** and **shedded request** at the same window: A **CSV file** with the number of processed requests until start shedding and the number of shedded requests at the this shedding.

### How to run
#### Parameters
* **number_of_servers**: The number of servers to be used.
* **duration**: How much time the simulation should take in seconds (must be integer or float).
* **scenario**: There is two scenarios, control and baseline. Control means servers using GCI and baseline means servers with no GCI.
* **load**: An integer meaning how much requests the load balance must to distribute to the servers.
* **output_path**: The path where the simulator should put the results.
* **data_path**: The path where the CSV files of experimental results are.
* **service_time_file_name**: The name of a file with the service time of each request processed in an experiment.
* **service_time_data_column**: The column number of that files (integer).
* **simulation_number**: An ID to identify each simulation result file.
* **shedding_file_name**: The name of the CSV file containing a pair of values needed to do shedding. 
* **shedding_number_of_files**: The number of shedding files.

#### Execution
After have cloned the simulator, move to the right director and execute one of those commands below. The command at Baseline simulates an experiment with **no GCI** on Servers, at control simulates with servers **using GCI**. The parameters must be passed as environment variables.

* ##### **Baseline**
  * NUMBER_OF_SERVERS="number_of_server" DURATION="duration" SCENARIO="**baseline**" LOAD="load" OUTPUT_PATH="output_path" DATA_PATH="data_path" SERVICE_TIME_FILE_NAME="service_time_file_name" SERVICE_TIME_DATA_COLUMN="service_time_data_column" SIMULATION_NUMBER="simulation_number" bash simulation_run.sh  
* ##### **Control**
  * NUMBER_OF_SERVERS="number_of_server" DURATION="duration" SCENARIO="**control**" LOAD="load" OUTPUT_PATH="output_path" DATA_PATH="data_path" SERVICE_TIME_FILE_NAME="service_time_file_name" SERVICE_TIME_DATA_COLUMN="service_time_data_column" SIMULATION_NUMBER="simulation_number" **SHEDDING_FILE_NAME="shedding_file_name" SHEDDING_NUMBER_OF_FILES="shedding_number_of_files"** bash simulation_run.sh  

Please, pay attention that the script run_simulation.sh already has some of these parameters with default values that make easier run simulations. 

### Results
For each simulation the simulator will generate two files: an information file and a CSV file. The name of the files follow the pattern shown below.
* Every information file: simulation_info_scenario_load_load_simulation_number. Example:  simulation_info_control_load_80_1. In this case, scenario is control, load is 80 and simulation_number is 1. 
* The CSV file with the dada of all requet: number_of_serverinstances_loadbalancer_request_status_scenario_const_load_simulation_number. Example: 2instances_loadbalancer_request_status_control_const_80_1, where 2 is number_of_server, control is scenario and 1 is the simulation_number.

The information file keeps the parameters used to simulate and some quick information and the CSV file keeps data of each request processed during the simulation. The column description follow below. 
* **id**: The request identify.
* **created_time**: The moment at the request was created.
* **latency**: The all life time of a request processed startind at its created moment until it be processed and finished.
* **service_time**: Is only the time that the request have passed in a server. 
* **done**: It gives the request state. True if the request was processed and False otherwise. 
* **times_forwarded**: It gives how many times a request was sent to a server.
